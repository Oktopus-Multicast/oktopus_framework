def all_pairs_dijkstra(G, cutoff=None, weight='weight'):
    """Find shortest weighted paths and lengths between all nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    cutoff : integer or float, optional
       Depth to stop the search. Only return paths with length <= cutoff.

    weight : string or function
       If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
       edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
       joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edge[u][v][weight]``). If no
       such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
       be one.

       If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
       returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
       positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
       dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
       return a number.

    Yields
    ------
    (node, (distance, path)) : (node obj, (dict, dict))
        Each source node has two associated dicts. The first holds distance
        keyed by target and the second holds paths keyed by target.
        (See single_source_dijkstra for the source/target node terminology.)
        If desired you can apply `dict()` to this function to create a dict
        keyed by source node to the two dicts.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> len_path = dict(nx.all_pairs_dijkstra(G))
    >>> print(len_path[3][0][1])
    2
    >>> for node in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]:
    ...     print('3 - {}: {}'.format(node, len_path[3][0][node]))
    3 - 0: 3
    3 - 1: 2
    3 - 2: 1
    3 - 3: 0
    3 - 4: 1
    >>> len_path[3][1][1]
    [3, 2, 1]
    >>> for n, (dist, path) in nx.all_pairs_dijkstra(G):
    ...     print(path[1])
    [0, 1]
    [1]
    [2, 1]
    [3, 2, 1]
    [4, 3, 2, 1]

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    The yielded dicts only have keys for reachable nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    terminal_nodes : list

        to be found.

    Returns

        Approximation to the minimum steiner tree of `G` induced by

    Notes
    -----
    Steiner tree can be approximated by computing the minimum spanning

    terminal nodes, where the metric closure of *G* is the complete graph in
    which each edge is weighted by the shortest path distance between the
    nodes in *G* .
    This algorithm produces a tree whose weight is within a (2 - (2 / t))
    factor of the weight of the optimal Steiner tree where *t* is number of
    terminal nodes.
